- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mark

I'm interested in software engineering. 

I've competence in coding in C++, Python and Javascript.

Currently, I'm interested in improving my object-oriented programming and web development skills with React - The Complete Guide on Udemy. 

I've got this Github linked to my Leetcode profile, where I practice coding interview questions.
